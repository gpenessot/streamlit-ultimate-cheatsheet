## 🎓 Take it to the next level

This cheat sheet gives you the basics, but **building production-level Streamlit applications** requires much more than knowing the API.

### Challenges you'll face sooner or later:
- 🍝 **Spaghetti code**: your `app.py` is 1000+ lines?
- 🐌 **Performance**: slow with datasets > 10k rows?
- 🔓 **Security**: how to protect sensitive data?
- 🚀 **Deployment**: tired of risky manual updates?

### The solution: enterprise-ready architecture

I created **[Streamlit Unleashed](https://www.mes-formations-data.fr/formation/streamlit-unleashed)** — the only training that teaches you to build **production-ready** Streamlit applications.

**What you'll learn:**
- 🏗️ **Modular architecture** that scales with your team
- ⚡ **Performance optimizations** to handle 100k+ rows instantly
- 🔒 **Robust authentication** (OAuth2, RBAC) validated by IT teams
- 🔄 **CI/CD pipeline** to deploy in 5 minutes stress-free
- 💼 **ROI justification** to convince your decision-makers

> *"Thanks to the architecture module, my app is now used by the entire company instead of crashing with 10+ users."* — **Alex, Senior Data Scientist**
